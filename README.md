## Elevator pitch:
*FOR* the super cafe owner 

*WHO* need their data data organised by:
* Sales
* Performance
* Products
* Stores

*THE* NUBI service 

*IS* a data engineering service 

*THAT* creates structure, organisation and security to build clear reports using data visualisations

*UNLIKE* manual processing of data and having separate disjointed forms of data
